# Linux Tools

A collection of shell scripts that leverage [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), which is designed for quick access to files, directories, clipboard contents, and more.

You can turn them into custom commands by sourcing them in your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`) file:

```bash
SCRIPT="$HOME/LINUX_tools"  # Replace with the actual path to the script folder

alias cdd="source $SCRIPT/cdd.sh"
alias open="source $SCRIPT/open.sh"
alias bright="source $SCRIPT/bright.sh"
alias rmv="source $SCRIPT/remove.sh"
alias copy="source $SCRIPT/copy.sh"
alias hh="source $SCRIPT/hh.sh"
```

> ⚠️ Make sure `fzf` and `xclip` (for clipboard usage) are installed on your system.
> Change the `xclip -selection` command depending on your needs.
